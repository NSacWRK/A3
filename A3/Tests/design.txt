Design Process:

There were many decisions that went made into completing the design process, whether that may have been from team consensus or what we felt like 
indiviually would work best from past experiences from past assignemnts - such as using similar Implementation from past Lab Asssignemnts or even the assignemnts
we've done in the past. For an example - in bit of the importDB, exportDB, freeDB, there were many insatnces and similairties between File I/O source codes that the teacher had provided
and from assignments we've done and labs, so we used bit of that as a guide to help us. 

Aside from that, there were many instances where the funtions we had to implement could use the same type of formatting, direction for implemnation.
For an example, both reportByWard and reportByNeighbourhood function implementation was to sort the Ward in ascending order, and Neighbourhoods by Alphabtical order,
so the same techniques, with slight differences of course for specific implemetation for the certain functiosn needed for it to work could be used in both functions 
for their implementation.

As for the usage of INIT_SIZE (where we had the option to use this depending on if used Arrays or Linked List) - we chose to go with Arrays;
as we've had greater experience dealing with this in multiple labs and assignments, and was something that most of us were familiar with. And Arrays 
did come with more advanatges for us (easier accessbility for certain functions (such as editTableEntry) where editing the table entry can be easily accessed by this).

In addition, there were many instances where we encoutnered issues Some of the issues we
encountered were some of our functions not working accordingly. But even then, some of us came together to discuss where certain issues may be pertainng
in order to fix those issues. We also used Lecture Notes/Slides, Lab Notes/Slides, and Source Codes teachers provided
were also used in combating certain issues to see if our implemntation of certain functions were incorrect many times - and even looking at past coding assignments 
we did in our labs (Assignment #1 and #2) and other Lab Assignment Submissions we had (as some of them carried forward) - and the implemntation could help us 
pinpoint if our function inmplemnetation was incorrect or wrong.
